 Its a process in which many different process are able to access same information.

# In how many states Threads can be explained ?// 5
The java thread states are as follows:

New - The thread is in new state if you create an instance of Thread class but before the invocation of start() method.
Runnable - The thread is in runnable state after invocation of start() method, but the thread scheduler has not selected it to be the running thread.
Running - The thread is in running state if the thread scheduler has selected it.
Non-Runnable (Blocked) - This is the state when the thread is still alive, but is currently not eligible to run.
Terminated - A thread is in terminated or dead state when its run() method exits.

# Consider the following code fragment:

int x;

int a = 5;

int b= 8;

x = ++a + b++;

After the execution of this code fragment, what is the value of x?// 14
# Consider the following code fragment:

1. public class Unary{

2. public static void main(String[] args) {
